                To get to know Tanya, you'll likely find him in three main places: hunched over his laptop, 
                coding and conducting software tests; tending to a farm, where he grows spinach; and at church, 
                singing with passion. In addition, you can catch him in the kitchen, baking and cooking up a storm.
                All these facets of his life are documented on his blog, where he delves into their significance in
                the broader world.

                He's also an avid traveler, but that's more of a long-term goal he's working towards to bring you more 
                content. Born on the 28th of June 2000, he currently calls Midrand Halfway Gardens home. He completed his high 
                school education at Eagle's Nest Christian School, where he proudly served as the deputy Head Boy and a library computer 
                guardian during Grade 12. I also went to Rosebank College and finished my diploma there which is why you are looking at this 
                amazing website.
